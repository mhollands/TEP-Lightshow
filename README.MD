This is the 2016 redesign of the Tau Epsilon Phi, Xi Chapter (MIT) light show. The aim is to have 32 individually addressable 20A wall outlets (on the ceiling). Using the DMX512 protocol, we will be able to turn on, turn off or dim any of the 32 outlets. The DMX signal will come from a PC. The main use of this is to flash the lights in accordance with the current music, via a frequency analysis of the sound, however it will likely also be used for controlling the general lighting in the room, as well as whatever we dream up.
